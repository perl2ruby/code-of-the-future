# Rust Tutorial Series

Code from Code of the Future's Rust YouTube series. More information found at: https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeoftheFuture 

To create binaries:
- Run the `create-makefile.sh` that generates `Makefile` in the same dir (This step is not needed unless new tutorials are added)
- Then run make

We also added a `.gitignore` file to avoid checking in binaries.
